It all started with the fridge... A white Kelvinator from the 90s, freezer on top and fridge underneath. This particular fridge belonged to Willien's parents and while there is nothing technically wrong with it, it is starting to show age.

The seals are tired and it has a nasty habit of leaking water across the kitchen tiles. Many a time have one of us almost broken bones after stumbling past the fridge in the morning, only to slip. Or walk innocently past in socks only to feel the cold embrace of freezing cold water being sucked up by thirsty footwear.

There is also the nasty habit where food sitting at the back of the shelves freezes solid.

Be that as it may, the sad truth is the fridge is just too small for us. We are a family of 3 and shopping day always ends in a game of fridge Tetris. And I'm too old for that.

We have been gently looking for a replacement over the last few years and one of the requirements was a water dispenser. Cut to 3 months ago and I am browsing the Makro website. There are some nice specials but there is also this monster of a Defy with double doors. Almost 600l and the price is really good, but it doesn't have a water dispenser.

We don't live in a mansion so we also worry that it is going to be too big. Out comes the tape measure and it will only extend slightly into the walking area. We can definitely make this work. Can we see past the lack of water dispenser?

Yes we can! I logon to the Makro website, add to cart, close my eyes and swipe the card. Delivery in a week. Nice!

Two days later, a Wednesday night, around 7 in the evening. I am busy making dinner - hake fillets dusted with seasoned flour and fried in a little oil, if you want to know. My phone rings, I look and it's an unknown number. I don't usually answer unknown numbers but what the heck, who is it at this time in the evening?

It's the couriers in a massive box-truck with the new fridge. Now I am only expecting the fridge in about a week so nothing has been prepared. But here we are, it's freezing cold and pitch dark.

At least it is a fancy truck with a platform that goes up and down. So the guys get the fridge onto a trolley. This thing weighs about 100kg. And they huff and puff it up the front stairs. I'm very glad there were two of them because if not that would have been a story for the diary.

They wheel the fridge into the lounge after navigating through the front door. I tell them to leave it there next to the couch. I will deal with it in the morning.

I had to get some help from the gardeners but now we are a two fridge family. We have finally made it to official adult-hood.

About a month ago our tumble dryer decided to toast it's logic board in such a way that it no longer gets hot. Which is annoying because that is the whole point of the dryer... So it still spins and makes a lot of noise but there is no heat on any of the settings. 

This dryer is also from Makro - we buy a lot of appliances from them - and it is not the first time we have had issues with this model. A month after we bought the first one in 2023 the door broke but I got a phone call saying there are no technicians covering our area and they will just do a refund as long as we drop the unit off at Makro.

We thought that was a wonderful idea and promptly bought another one. Exactly the same model...

Luckily this broken dryer is still in the warranty period.

So being innocent and thinking they will just replace it like last time, I called Makro. But no! Since the olden days of 2023 a technician has unfortunately been employed to cover our area. So first we need to wait for the vendor to give out a reference number and few days later I got an email with details. A few days after that I hear from the technicians. Bleh, that's annoying...

Anyway... long story short, the technicians came out on a rainy day and made their diagnosis. They recommended that the vendor replace the whole dryer as getting parts is going to take more than a month. Anyway, more than a month later we are still waiting for a decision. In the middle of winter! Sometimes when it rains our lounge looks more like a Victorian era wash-house than a home.

We should have just made an insurance claim...

But not to be outdone by either the new fridge or the dryer shenanigans our stove decided it no longer needed an oven anymore. For extra drama the oven stopped oven-ing in the middle of drying Willien's newly baked rusks.

After an evening of baking, slicing, and stacking beskuit to be dried overnight in the oven we wake up to cold and wet cake. We usually leave the oven on the lowest heat with a wooden spoon jammed in the door to leave a gap and then go to bed. In the morning the beskuit are lekker dry, just ready for a breakfast dunk.

Not this morning... I decided the element must have died. The stove is a 40 year old Defy 420 Thermofan from the 1980s so at least there are no fancy electronics and getting the element out is quite easy. You have to climb into the oven and unscrew the back plate and then pull out wires at the back and the element comes out.

Finding a new element is not as easy because if you ask Defy they have never heard of a model 420. So I take the broken element down to the local electronic shop in Ceres and they have a 3000 watt element, the one that came out is a 2500 watt. I don't want to risk burning anything out so they will order an element and it will be ready to pick up in about a week.

Ok! Good! Annoying to have to wait so long in 2025 but whatever. We can live without an oven for a few days. I picked up the element, reattached it and all turned out well. The oven is fully functional again.

Unfortunately the beskuit never dried so we ate as many as we could stomach and gave the rest away.
